        <h2>Welcome to My Page!</h2>
        <p>I'm ThisUser, why do I have my username as ThisUser-Bot? No clue but I can assure you that I am definitely a human and not a bot.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Everyone loves a good about me section but I only have a few things to share:</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">1) I like coding HTML.</p> 
        <p style="text-align: left;">2) I will in no shape or form help around on GitHub since I don't have the skills needed.</p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">3) I will star a bunch of repos, it's something that I do.</p>
        <p>And yes, I could've done a list instead of separate paragraphs.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Socials</h2>
        <p>A good page has at least some socials to follow, so here's mines.</p>
        <p><a href="https://social.hatto.dev/@thisuser0494"><button style="cursor: pointer;"><code>Mastodon</code></button></a> - I've been fairly active lately as of Feb. 21, 2023. This is one of the newest social media platforms I've signed up for. It's pretty good for now.</p>
        <p><a href="https://bluejay1812.newgrounds.com"><button style="cursor: pointer;"><code>Newgrounds</code></button></a> - Although I'm not that active on Newgrounds, it's a nice place to visit from time to time. You may notice that my username is different, my gamertag is BlueJay1048, not BlueJay1812.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>That's all folks!</h2>
        <p>A bit boring I know. I'll get better at this sooner or later.</p>
        <p>Thanks for dropping by. Have a great day!</p>
